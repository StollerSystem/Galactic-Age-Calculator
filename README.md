## Description

This application will take the age from the user and then they can choose a planet in the solar system. The app will then calculate what their relative age would be on that planet based on it's solar years. 

## Specs

* [X] 1 Determine their age in Mercury years (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 208

* [X] 2 Determine their age in Venus years (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 80

* [X] 3 Determine their age in Mars years (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 26

* [X] 4 Determine their age in Jupiter years (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 4

* [X] 5 Determine how many years left the user has left to live on that planet based on average life expectancy.
  * Input: 50 (overall average expectancy is 71 on earth - on Jupiter 6...ouch!)
  * Expect: 2 years to live! 

* [X] 6 If the user has already surpassed the life expectancy, return how many years they have lived past...good job!

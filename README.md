## Description

This application will take the age from the user and then they can choose a planet from the list. The app will then calculate what their relative age would be on that planet based on it's solar years. Then at the bottom they can click to see how many years they might have left to live on that planet based on the average life expectancy of 71. If their age is over 71 then the app will tell you how many years you have lived over the average. 

## Specs

* [X] 1 Determine their age in Mercury years (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 208

* [X] 2 Determine their age in Venus years (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 80

* [X] 3 Determine their age in Mars years (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 26

* [X] 4 Determine their age in Jupiter years (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
  * Input: 50
  * Expect: 4

* [X] 5 Determine how many years left the user has left to live on that planet based on average life expectancy.
  * Input: 50 (overall average expectancy is 71 on earth - on Jupiter 6...ouch!)
  * Expect: 2 years to live! 

* [X] 6 If the user has already surpassed the life expectancy, return how many years they have lived past...good job!
